I asked the Lord that I might grow  
In faith and love and ev’ry grace,  
Might more of His salvation know,  
And seek more earnestly His face.  
  
‘Twas He who taught me thus to pray,  
And He, I trust, has answered prayer,  
But it has been in such a way  
As almost drove me to despair.  
  
I hoped that in some favored hour  
At once He’d answer my request  
And, by His love’s constraining pow’r,  
Subdue my sins and give me rest.  
  
Instead of this, He made me feel  
The hidden evils of my heart  
And let the angry pow’rs of hell  
Assault my soul in ev’ry part.  
  
Yea, more with His own hand He seemed  
Intent to aggravate my woe,  
Crossed all the fair designs I schemed,  
Humbled my heart and laid me low.  
  
“Lord, why is this,” I trembling cried;  
“Wilt Thou pursue Thy worm to death?”  
“’Tis in this way,” the Lord replied,  
“I answer prayer for grace and faith.”  
  
“These inward trials I employ  
From self and pride to set thee free  
And break thy schemes of earthly joy  
That thou may’st find thy all in Me.”
