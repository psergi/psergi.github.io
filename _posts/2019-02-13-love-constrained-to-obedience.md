No strength of nature can suffice  
To serve the Lord aright:  
And what she has she misapplies,  
For want of clearer light.  

How long beneath the law I lay  
In bondage and distress;  
I toil'd the precept to obey,  
But toil'd without success.  

Then, to abstain from outward sin  
Was more than I could do;  
Now, if I feel its power within,  
I feel I hate it too.  

Then all my servile works were done  
A righteousness to raise;  
Now, freely chosen in the Son,  
I freely choose His ways.  

"What shall I do," was then the word,  
"That I may worthier grow?"  
"What shall I render to the Lord?"  
Is my inquiry now.  
 
To see the law by Christ fulfilled  
And hear His pardoning voice,  
Changes a slave into a child,  
And duty into choice.
