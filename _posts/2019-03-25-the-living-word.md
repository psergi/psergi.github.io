> `1` Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
>  
> `2` But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
>  
> `3` And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
>  
> `4` The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
>  
> `5` Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
>  
> `6` For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
>  
> <cite>–Psalm 1</cite>


> `38` He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
>  
> <cite>–John 7:38</cite>


> `1` I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
>  
> `2` Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
>  
> `3` Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
>  
> `4` Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
>  
> `5` I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
>  
> `6` If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
>  
> <cite>–John 15:1-6</cite>
